diff_runs.py
-------------
Compares two output files from this project (JSON, as written by
output_writer.save) and reports what changed between them, keyed on `sku` —
LG's own model code.

    python3 diff_runs.py --old tv_products.2026-09-01.json \\
                          --new tv_products.2026-09-21.json

Typical use is a scheduled re-run of one of the engines, kept under a dated
filename, diffed against the previous one:

    python3 playwright_scraper.py --url "$URL" --out "tv_$(date +%F)"
    python3 diff_runs.py --old "tv_$(ls -t tv_*.json | sed -n 2p)" \\
                          --new "saas_$(date +%F).json" --out diff.json

Four buckets, each keyed on sku:

  added          — sku present in --new, absent from --old
  removed        — sku present in --old, absent from --new (discontinued, or simply
                   off this particular page of this run)
  changed        — sku present in both, with a different price,
                   original_price, discount_pct, currency, status, sale
                   method or monthly profit
  source_changed — sku present in both with a different price, but also a
                   different price_source: one run read the catalogue API and
                   the other the rendered grid, so the two are not comparable
                   on price. Reported on its own because it says something
                   about our two snapshots, not about the site — and
                   --fail-on-change ignores it.

A row this project's parser could not recover a sku for (None) cannot be
matched across runs at all, so it is counted and reported separately rather
than silently folded into "added"/"removed", which would be wrong on its face.
